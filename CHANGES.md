## 1.13.10

### Behaviour change

**Where the proper pair filter flag is used, this code now checks that the paired-end orientation is also used.**
**This will mean that mate-pair orientation (F/F or R/R) will be rejected**
**If you wish to use mate-pair data, please use previous version**

* Where a proper pair filter is used, now check for the correct paired-end orientation of F/R.
* If this is not met the read is ignored.

## 1.13.9
